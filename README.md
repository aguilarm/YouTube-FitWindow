YouTube FitWindow (ytFitWin)
========

I'm not a huge fan of fullscreen or the theatre mode YouTube has by default, so I made this extension that will resize videos to fit your window but still show the search bar.  It also auto resizes to fit when you resize your window, so you can always see the whole video no matter what size you want the window to be.

## ToDo

- Add settings page so user can turn on/off searchbar or make FitWin the default size
- Force 1080 or 720p
